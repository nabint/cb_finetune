{"prompt": "Overview", "response": "Call Break (aka CallBreak, Call Bridge, Lakdi) is a four-player trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck (no jokers). There are no partnerships — every player plays for themselves. Spades are permanent trump. Objective: each player bids (calls) how many tricks they expect to take (1–13) and then tries to win at least that many tricks."}
{"prompt": "Setup & Deal", "response": "Players: 4. Deck: standard 52-card deck. Dealer: chosen randomly and rotates each hand (usually clockwise, though some local variants use anti-clockwise). Deal: 13 cards to each player (all cards dealt). Play direction: typically clockwise. Decide house rules (scoring variant, redeal conditions) before starting."}
{"prompt": "Card ranking & trump", "response": "Card rank within suits: A (high), K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (low). Spades are always trump and beat any card of other suits regardless of rank. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick unless a spade is played; then the highest spade wins."}
{"prompt": "Bidding / Calling phase", "response": "After seeing their 13 cards each player states a call (an integer 1–13) that is the minimum number of tricks they pledge to win that hand. Minimum call commonly enforced is 1. Calls are final once made. House variants: some groups convert very high calls into bonus calls (see scoring variants)."}
{"prompt": "Lead & following rules", "response": "First trick leader: varies by local rule (often the player right/left of dealer). Leader plays any card. Subsequent players must follow suit if they have that suit. If void, they may play any card — including spades (trump). Trick winner: highest of suit led unless spades present; if spades played, highest spade wins. Winner leads next trick."}
{"prompt": "Scoring (common/classic variant)", "response": "Common scoring: If player makes at least their call: they score +call (some variants also add small bonus per overtrick). If player fails to meet their call: they lose points equal to their call (score −call). Some groups play fixed rounds (e.g., 5) or until a target score (e.g., 300) and highest total wins."}
{"prompt": "Scoring variants & bonuses", "response": "Because Call Break has many local variants: • No-overtricks: overtricks ignored (player only gains call amount). • Overtrick bonus: some implementations give +0.1 or +1 per extra trick. • Bonus calls: some rules award fixed bonus for very large calls (e.g., calling 8+ may score 13 on success). • Sandbag rules (from Spades): track overtricks as 'bags' and penalize accumulation. Always agree on scoring before play."}
{"prompt": "Penalties, misdeals, reneging", "response": "Common penalties: • Reneging (failing to follow suit when able): may cause immediate loss of the hand or other penalties (house-specific). • Misdeal: redeal if cards are exposed or deal error. • Disputes: resolve by majority or redeal per house rules. Clarify penalty rules before starting."}
{"prompt": "Legal plays examples (follow / void / trump)", "response": "1) You have suit led: you MUST follow suit and play a card of that suit. 2) You are void in suit: you may play any card; playing a spade attempts to win the trick. 3) Leading: you may lead any card; some house rules forbid leading spades until spades are 'broken'. Example: Leader plays 7♦; if you hold any ♦ you must play a ♦; if not, you may play 2♠ to trump."}
{"prompt": "Which card to play — practical advice", "response": "General guidelines: • To lose a trick while following, play your lowest card of the suit. • When void and needing the trick, play the smallest spade that will beat current spades to conserve higher trumps. • Save A♠ and K♠ for late 'must-win' tricks; use medium trumps to take early contested tricks. • Lead long suits where you are strong to draw out opponents' trumps. • If overtrick penalties exist, sometimes intentionally discard a would-be winning card to avoid 'bags'."}
{"prompt": "Situational examples (mini hand patterns)", "response": "Example A — Strong trump hand: A♠ K♠ Q♠ 9♠ + high hearts: reasonable call 6–8 depending on distribution. Example B — No spades but long strong suit: lead that suit early to try and win tricks before opponents trump. Example C — Last tricks and you need exactly N: play conservatively, avoid wasting trumps unless necessary."}
{"prompt": "Advanced tips & bookkeeping", "response": "Track played high cards and count remaining trumps. Watch opponents' bids to infer targets. Distribute trumps across the hand; avoid wasting all high trumps early. Manage overtricks relative to your scoring variant. Deceptive discards can mislead opponents about your holdings."}
{"prompt": "Common house rules checklist (decide before starting)", "response": "Agree on: scoring variant (how overtricks count), redeal conditions, whether spades can be led immediately, penalties for reneging, number of rounds or target score, and special bonuses (e.g., 13-trick bonus). Clarify tie-breaking and who keeps score."}
{"prompt": "Examples — bidding & scoring concrete", "response": "Example 1 (successful): Call 5, win 7 → score +5 (or +5 +overtrick-bonus depending on variant). Example 2 (missed): Call 6, win 4 → score −6. Example 3 (slam): Call 13 & win 13 → house-specific large bonus."}
